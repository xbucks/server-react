# server-reason-react

Implementation of React, ReactDOM and a few related libraries in OCaml, to enable Server-side Rendering on reason-react components.

> **Warning**
> This repo is in an early stage for public consumtion. It's already used in production in [app.ahrefs.com](https://app.ahrefs.com) for all users, but the shape of the libraries, a few missing APIs to implement and missing documentation make it hard for anyone to use.
> Even with all of this, you are still interested in it, please contact me via Discord or email.
> If you are interesting in the progress, I share stuff on my [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/davesnx).
