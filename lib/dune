; We want to keep the exact interface from ReasonReact
; This layout of native-react.react isn't ideal. Since bsconfig exposes
; every file as module, similarly on what (wrapped false) does.
; We didn't use wrapped false since it will be all under a "React" namespace
; and it's not the same as bs.
; Current solution is to export all libs manually
